        There are six heading levels from h1 (the highest) to h6 (the lowest)
    </h2>
    <h3>
        When a heading is nested in a document banner '<'header'>', it is the heading for the application or site
    </h3>
    <h4>
        When nested in '<'main'>', whether or not it is nested within a '<'header'>' in '<'main'>', it is the header for that page, not the whole site
    </h4>
    <h5>
        When nested in an '<'article'>' or '<'section'>', it is the header for that subsection of the page
    </h5>
    <h5>
        Headings usage notes are as follows:
    </h5>
    <h6>
        Heading information can be used by user agents to construct a table of contents for a document automatically
    </h6>
    <h6>
        Do not use heading elements to resize text. Instead, use the CSS font-size property
    </h6>
    <h6>
        Do not skip heading levels: always start from '<'h1'>', followed by '<'h2'>' and so on
    </h6>
